I am a senior technical leader, cloud architect and agile professional. Currently the VP of Infrastructure Engineering at ESL FACEIT Group and previously served as the Head of Engineering at Unity Technologies and Global CTO of Lush Cosmetics. I brain dump blog here about technical leadership, engineering management and technology.

## How can I help?



## Speaking

I've been known to stand in front of large groups of people, pace back and forth, be animated with my hands, whilst talking about subjects I'm passionate about from time to time.
