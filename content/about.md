Hey folks, I am Ryan - I am a software engineering leader, currently serving as VP of Infrastructure at ESL FACEIT Group, where I lead teams across infrastructure, security, and reliability. Before that, I was Senior Director of Engineering at Unity Technologies, and Global CTO at Lush Cosmetics alongside a few other roles in technology.

This blog is my digital brain dump: expect thoughts on technical leadership, infrastructure strategy, AI in engineering orgs, and lessons from the edge of scale.

## How can I help?

I'm open to:

- Advisory roles for scaling startups or growing tech orgs where infrastructure, developer velocity, or security maturity are critical enablers.
- Non-Executive Director (NED) positions, especially where technical oversight and strategic growth support are needed at board level.

If you're scaling and could use a fresh perspective or a critical friend on your journey - letâ€™s talk.

## Speaking

I enjoy stepping on stage and unpacking complex ideas with energy and a bit of humour. Here are a few highlights:

- 03, 2024: Game Developer Network - Cloudflare XXX.
- X.
- X.
- 04, 2017: Google Next London - 22 Day Lush Migration to the cloud.

More to come. I tend to say yes when the topic is right and the tea is good.
