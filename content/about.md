Hey folks - Iâ€™m Ryan Kerry, a software engineering leader with experience building and leading teams across engineering, infrastructure, and security. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked in a range of environments, from fast-paced startups to global technology organisations, helping build impactful products and resilient platforms. My past roles haved included: VP of Engineering at {{< extlink text="ESL FACEIT Group" url="https://eslfaceitgroup.com/" >}}, Senior Director of Engineering at {{< extlink text="Unity" url="https://unity.com/" >}}, and Global Head of Technology at {{< extlink text="Lush Cosmetics" url="https://www.lush.com/" >}}.

This is where I unpack what Iâ€™ve learned from scaling technology and leading teams to exploring how AI is reshaping modern engineering.

## How can I help?

Iâ€™m open to a range of opportunities where I can support others through experience, perspective, and practical guidance:

- Mentorship, coaching, or 1:1 sessions with engineering leaders navigating growth, scale, or transitions in their careers.
- Advisory roles with startups or growing tech organisations where infrastructure, developer experience, or security maturity are critical to success.
- Non-Executive Director (NED) positions, particularly where technical oversight and strategic guidance are valued at the board level.

If youâ€™re scaling and would benefit from a sounding board or a critical friend - letâ€™s talk. You can connect with me on {{< extlink text="Linkedin" url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryank90/" >}} or email me at rk@evolvingcomplexity.com.
