Hey folks, I am Ryan - I am a software engineering leader, currently serving as VP of Infrastructure at {{< extlink text="ESL FACEIT Group" url="https://eslfaceitgroup.com/" >}}, where I lead teams across infrastructure, security, and reliability. Before that, I was Senior Director of Engineering at {{< extlink text="Unity" url="https://unity.com/" >}}, and Global CTO at {{< extlink text="Lush" url="https://www.lush.com/" >}} alongside a few other past roles in technology.

This blog is my digital brain dump: expect thoughts on technical leadership, infrastructure strategy, AI in engineering orgs, and lessons from the edge of scale.

## How can I help?

I'm open to:

- Advisory roles for scaling startups or growing tech orgs where infrastructure, developer velocity, or security maturity are critical enablers.
- Non-Executive Director (NED) positions, especially where technical oversight and strategic growth support are needed at board level.

If you're scaling and could use a fresh perspective or a critical friend on your journey - let's talk.

## Speaking

I enjoy stepping on stage and unpacking complex ideas with energy and a bit of humour. Here are a few highlights:

- **March, 2024:** Game Developer Network (GDC): Cloudflare XXX.
- **XX, 20XX:** Google Lighthouse - London: XXX.
- **XX, 20XX:** Retail Expo - London (Session): XX.
- **March, 2018:** Google Next - San Francisco (Keynote): XXX.
- **April, 2017:** Google Next - London (Session): XXXX.
- **April, 2017:** Google Next - London (Keynote): 22 Day Lush Migration to the cloud.

More to come. I tend to say yes when the topic is right and the tea is good.
