XBuilding and evolving the security organisation at EFG has been one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of my role especially as it was new territory for me, and pushed me to grow well beyond my comfort zone.

When I stepped into this space, I knew that shaping a modern security capability would be as much about mindset and culture as about tools and controls. Security can too easily become isolated, process-heavy, and treated as "someone else’s problem." I’ve been working hard, alongside a talented team, to change that.

This post captures some of the key lessons (including a few hard ones) from the journey so far: where we started, what we’ve been learning along the way, and how we’re reshaping security to be a trusted partner and enabler across the business and not a blocker.

## Where we began

Like many companies, our early security efforts were a mix of compliance-driven work, reactive incident response, and point-in-time reviews. Security was largely seen as a necessary function to meet external requirements, not as a strategic capability.



Some common challenges we faced:

- Security was reactive — most of our time was spent responding to incidents and escalations.
- The team was isolated — we didn’t have strong relationships with product, engineering, or business teams.
- We were perceived as blockers — processes were opaque, turnaround times were long, and communication wasn’t great.
- There was no clear “security culture” in the wider company — beyond a few training modules.

We knew this had to change.

## Our new approach

Our vision is simple: Security should be a trusted partner that enables the business to move fast — safely.

To get there, we needed to rethink our role, our mindset, and how we engage across the company.

Here are some of the core principles we now operate by:

### Embed, don't police

We aim to work side-by-side with teams, not as an external review board. We spend time understanding how different parts of the business operate and where security needs to fit into their workflows.

Where possible, we embed security expertise into engineering and product teams — either through dedicated security engineers or through champions and shared accountability.

### Speak the language of the business

Security teams sometimes fall into the trap of talking in jargon and focusing only on risks and threats.

- We’re learning to frame security in terms that resonate:
- How does this help us protect our customers?
- How does this reduce operational risk?
- How does this support our ability to ship and scale safely?

### Offer choices not just rules

Instead of saying “you must do X,” we aim to say:

- “Here are your options.”
- “Here’s the risk tradeoff.”
- “Here’s our recommended path.”

Giving teams informed choices builds trust and encourages proactive engagement.

### Build relationships before we need them

When the first conversation someone has with security is during an incident — that’s already too late.

We proactively build relationships across engineering, product, legal, compliance, operations, and the wider business.

It’s an ongoing investment, but it pays dividends when time-critical decisions need to be made.

### Scale through champions and tooling

The security team alone can’t scale to cover everything — nor should it.

We focus on:

- Developing security champions within engineering teams.
- Automating security controls and checks so they are part of standard workflows (e.g. CI/CD pipelines).
- Building self-service capabilities so teams can own their security posture.

## Key milestones achieved so far

Here are a few concrete examples of how this has played out:

### Modernising Cloud Secuirty

We partnered with engineering to define lightweight ownership and accountability models for cloud resources.

We implemented tagging, visibility tooling, and automated guardrails — not to stop teams from moving fast, but to ensure we all know what’s deployed and how it’s protected.

### Shifting left on AppSec

We’ve moved from reactive code review to providing secure-by-default tooling:

- Libraries and frameworks with security baked in.
- Security linting and SAST integrated into developer pipelines.
- Easy access to threat models and best practice guides.

Our goal is to make the secure path the easiest path.

### Office & Remote Security

As hybrid work became the norm, we revisited our assumptions about “the corporate perimeter.”
We’ve focused on standardising visibility and detection across all environments — whether in-office, at home, or on the move — with a zero-trust mindset.

### Building a Secuirty Culture

We launched a Security Champions programme and created bite-sized, practical resources:

- Definition of Done security checklists.
- Secure coding guides.
- Awareness campaigns focused on real-world examples.
- Recognition and rewards for security contributions.

We’ve seen great uptake — and critically, much more inbound engagement from teams.

## Lessons learned

A few hard-won insights:

- Start with empathy. Understand what other teams are trying to achieve — and how security can help, not hinder.
- Listen more than you talk. We spent a lot of time asking: “What would help you do your job more securely?”
- Iterate and adapt. Big security “overhauls” rarely stick. Small, continuous improvements win trust over time.
- Transparency matters. Share not just what decisions were made, but why. Explain tradeoffs openly.

## What's next?

We still have a lot to do. Our focus areas for the next year include:

- Scaling our champions programme further.
- Deepening automation of security testing and observability.
- Evolving secure defaults for new products and platforms.
- Continuing to improve how we measure and communicate security outcomes.

Security isn’t a static discipline. As our business evolves, so too must our approach. But we’re proud of the progress we’ve made moving from “security as gatekeeper” to “security as enabler”.

And we’re just getting started.
