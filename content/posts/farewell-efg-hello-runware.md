After an incredible journey at ESL FACEIT Group, I have taken the decision to move on and begin a new chapter. I am joining Runware to lead their engineering organisation, and it is a move I am genuinely excited about.

My time at EFG has been one of the most rewarding periods of my career. I had the opportunity to lead across infrastructure, security, and platform engineering while supporting systems that serve millions of players. I learned a great deal about scaling teams, improving reliability, and bringing engineering, product, and business functions together around clear outcomes. Most importantly, I had the privilege of working with talented and dedicated people who care deeply about their craft. I am grateful for the trust, collaboration, and shared achievements during my time there.

Runware represents an opportunity that feels rare and meaningful. The company is focused on building high performance inference for generative media, which sits directly in the space I enjoy most. Distributed systems, orchestration, developer experience, reliability, and the challenge of taking fast evolving AI workloads and turning them into stable and trustworthy products. It is a chance to help shape the engineering direction of a rapidly growing AI company and to build operational maturity and platform stability from the ground up.

I am energised by the ambition of the team, the speed at which the product is evolving, and the opportunity to make a real impact at an early stage. Joining now means stepping into a moment where strong engineering leadership directly influences the future of the company.

To everyone at EFG, thank you. I am proud of what we built together and grateful for the journey.

To the team at Runware, I am looking forward to what we will build next.

Onwards.
