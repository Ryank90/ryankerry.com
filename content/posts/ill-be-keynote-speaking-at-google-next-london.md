I'm thrilled to have taken the stage at Google NEXT 2017 in London, joining Google Cloud CTO Brian Stevens during the Day 1 keynote to share the story of Lush‚Äôs rapid migration to Google Cloud - completed in just 22 days.

Representing Lush Digital, I had the privilege of presenting alongside an exceptional engineering team‚ÄîDan Richards, Lee Hill, Simon Ince, and myself‚Äîsupported by two outstanding partners: Ancoris (project coordination) and Clarinet (technical delivery). Together, we achieved what many thought impossible: a complete, global e-commerce infrastructure migration in record time.

## Why We Migrated

The decision to move came as our contract with a legacy, black-box infrastructure provider was coming to an end. We saw an opportunity to take greater ownership of our platform, scale more efficiently, and future-proof our architecture.

After attending one of the early Google NEXT events in London (2016) with one of my senior engineers, it became crystal clear: Cloud was the future. Google Cloud, in particular, stood out‚Äînot just for its technical capabilities, but also for its values. From being powered by 100% renewable energy to its commitment to open-source communities, Google Cloud aligned perfectly with Lush Cosmetics' ethical principles and the foundations on which our engineering culture was built.

## The Migration Challenge

Once the decision was made, we had 28 days to complete the migration before the existing contract expired. Within just a few days, we‚Äôd contacted Google, secured the right partners, signed contracts, planned the roadmap‚Äîand even started writing code. What followed was an intense, fast-paced, and incredibly rewarding project.

From late-night deployments to sprint reviews on very little sleep, our team delivered a full migration in just 22 days, supporting global e-commerce operations and setting a new bar for cloud transformations.
