Meetings are an essential part of any engineering organisation. They provide a platform for collaboration, decision-making, and sharing information. However, not all meetings are productive, and ineffective meetings can be a significant waste of time and resources. Here are some pointers for ensuring that your meetings in your team remain effective.

## Set clear objectives

Every meeting should have a clear objective. Before scheduling a meeting, determine what you hope to achieve by the end of it. The objective should be specific, measurable, and achievable. It should also be communicated to all participants beforehand so that they come prepared and know what to expect in the meeting.

## Invite the right people

Having the right people in a meeting is crucial to its success. Only invite those who need to be there and can contribute meaningfully to the discussion or achieving the objective. If someone is not essential to the meeting, they should be excluded to avoid wasting their time and the organisation's resources.

## Create an agenda

Creating an agenda is an essential part of having effective meetings. It ensures that everyone is aware of the topics to be discussed and allows them to prepare ahead of the meeting. The agenda should be sent out to everyone before the meeting (consider also having it present in the meeting invite), along with any relevant materials, such as documents or slides. This way, everyone has time to review and really come prepared.

## Use technology to your advantage

With advancements in technology, there are now many tools available to help make meetings more effective. Video conferencing software like Zoom or Google Meets can be used for remote meetings, while collaborative software like Google Docs can be used to take notes and assign tasks. The use of technology can help keep meetings focused and productive.

## Timebox the meeting

Timeboxing is the practice of setting a specific time limit for a meeting. This practice helps keep meetings on track and prevents them from dragging on for too long. Participants should be aware of the timebox before the meeting starts and reminded of it during the meeting. This practice also ensures that everyone has a chance to speak and prevents any one person from dominating the conversation.

## Follow up after the meeting

After the meeting, it's essential to follow up with attendees to ensure that the action items are being addressed. This follow-up can be done through a summary email or through internal communication tools like Slack. It's also essential to review the meeting's effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments for future meetings.

In conclusion, effective meetings are an essential part of any engineering organisation. By setting clear objectives, inviting the right people, creating an agenda, using technology, timeboxing the meeting, and following up, your meetings will be more productive and efficient. These practices will not only save time and resources but also contribute to a positive work culture where everyone is valued and heard.
