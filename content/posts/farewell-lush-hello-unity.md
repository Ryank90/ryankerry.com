After four and a half incredible years, today marks the end of my journey at Lush. What started as a small, tight-knit team of just four engineers within the Poole headquarters grew into a technology powerhouse of over 70 talented individuals globally delivering business impact.

Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of helping shape and scale a world-class team across software engineering and technology. Together, we:

- Built one of the largest global e-commerce platforms on Drupal, contributing to and leveraging the open-source community.
- Designed and delivered an interconnected digital and physical ecosystem spanning retail, manufacturing, and fulfilment - integrating our e-commerce platform and fulfilment systems with an in-house developed POS, all powered by a microservices architecture running locally (in-store, manufacturing, fulfilment) and in the cloud.
- Led the rapid migration of our entire global infrastructure to Google Cloud in just 22 days right ahead of our busiest trading period enabling a stable and scalable foundation for a successful Christmas and Boxing Day.
- Developed the strategy and laid the foundation for a dedicated Technology Lab, focused on driving innovation in ways that reflect Lush’s core values and ethics.

These are just a few of the many achievements we delivered as a team and I couldn’t be prouder of what we built together. It’s been a period of immense growth, professionally and personally, and I’m grateful for every challenge, every lesson, and every colleague who made it such a formative experience.

With that, I’m excited to share that I’ll be joining Unity Technologies as a Head of Engineering within their Cloud Services organisation. Unity has long been a company I admire and I’m thrilled to be stepping into this next chapter.

To those at Lush: thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief.
