After four and a half incredible years, today marks the end of my journey at Lush. What started as a small, tight-knit team of just four engineers grew into a global technology organisation of over 70 people. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of helping shape and scale a team that’s delivered impactful, meaningful work — all while staying true to the company’s values and ethics.

It’s been a period of immense growth — professionally and personally — and I’m grateful for every challenge, every lesson, and every colleague who made it such a formative experience.

With that, I’m excited to share that I’ll be joining Unity Technologies as a Head of Engineering within their Cloud Services organisation. Unity has long been a company I admire — innovative, ambitious, and deeply embedded in the world of real-time 3D technology — and I’m thrilled to be stepping into this next chapter.

To those at Lush: thank you for the trust, the collaboration, and the belief.
