Today marks the end of an incredible 5-year chapter at Unity Technologies as their Senior Director of Engineering, where I had the privilege of leading software engineering for the Multiplayer Product Suite within Unity Gaming Services.

Some personal highlights from this journey:

- Integrated Multiplay into Unity from an engineering perspective — bringing people, platforms, and technology together as part of the broader Unity Gaming Services vision.
- Witnessed Unity's IPO on the NYSE — an incredible milestone and a moment of immense pride for everyone across the company.
- Scaled the Multiplayer engineering organisation from just 6 people to over 150+ engineers globally — building a team capable of delivering world-class multiplayer technology to game developers worldwide.
- Supported the successful integration of two acquisitions into the Multiplayer organisation — helping to expand Unity's capabilities and ecosystem in this space.

As I reflect on this chapter, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities, the challenges, and most importantly, the people I've had the chance to work alongside. I'm proud of what we accomplished together — and excited to see where the team takes it next.

Looking ahead, I'm thrilled to share that I'll be joining ESL FACEIT Group as VP of Infrastructure — helping to evolve and scale the platforms and services that power some of the world's largest competitive gaming experiences.

To everyone at Unity: thank you for the trust, collaboration, and shared ambition.
