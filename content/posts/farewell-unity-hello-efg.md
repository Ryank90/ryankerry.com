Today marks the end of an incredible five-year chapter at Unity Technologies, where I served as Senior Director of Engineering leading software engineering for the Multiplayer Product Suite within Unity Gaming Services.

Some personal highlights from this journey include:

- Integrating Multiplay into Unity from an engineering perspective, bringing together people, platforms and technology as part of the broader Unity Gaming Services vision.
- Witnessing Unity’s IPO on the NYSE, an incredible milestone and a moment of immense pride for everyone across the company.
- Scaling the Multiplayer engineering organisation from just six people to more than 150 engineers globally, building a team capable of delivering world-class multiplayer technology to game developers worldwide.
- Supporting the successful integration of two acquisitions into the Multiplayer organisation, expanding Unity’s capabilities and ecosystem in this space.

As I reflect on this chapter, I am deeply grateful for the opportunities, the challenges, and above all, the people I had the privilege to work alongside. I am proud of what we accomplished together and excited to see where the team takes it next.

Looking ahead, I am thrilled to be joining ESL FACEIT Group as VP of Engineering focued on Infrastructure, where I will help evolve and scale the platforms and services that power some of the world’s largest competitive gaming experiences.

To everyone at Unity - thank you for the trust, collaboration and shared ambition.
