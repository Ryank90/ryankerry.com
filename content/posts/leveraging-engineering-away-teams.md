In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, businesses need to be agile and adaptable to stay competitive. Whether you're developing a new software application, constructing a new building, or manufacturing a new product, you need access to the right skills, expertise, and resources to succeed. That's where engineering away teams come in. In this post, we'll explore the benefits and challenges of engineering away teams, and share best practices and case studies to help you optimise your global workforce.

## What are Engineering Away Teams?

Engineering away teams are groups of engineers, designers, and other technical experts who work remotely or travel to a client's site to support a specific project or mission. They can be employed by the same company or contracted from third-party providers. Engineering away teams are becoming increasingly popular in various industries, such as software development, construction, and manufacturing, where projects require specialized knowledge and resources that may not be available in-house.

## Benefits of Engineering Away Teams

Increased Efficiency and Productivity - Engineering away teams can help you complete projects faster and more efficiently by leveraging their expertise and experience. They can work around the clock, across time zones, and collaborate seamlessly with your in-house team using modern communication tools and platforms. They can also help you reduce costs by avoiding travel expenses and minimizing downtime.

Flexibility and Adaptability - Engineering away teams can help you respond to changing project requirements and timelines by adjusting their scope and deliverables accordingly. They can provide you with a fresh perspective and innovative ideas that can enhance your product or service. They can also help you navigate cultural and language barriers that may hinder your global expansion.

Access to Specialized Expertise and Resources - Engineering away teams can help you tap into a global talent pool of highly skilled and experienced professionals who can bring unique perspectives and insights to your projects. They can provide you with access to cutting-edge technologies and tools that can boost your competitive advantage. They can also help you comply with local regulations and standards that may vary from country to country.

Enhanced Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing - Engineering away teams can help you foster a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing across your organization by bringing together diverse backgrounds and experiences. They can help you break down silos and improve communication between departments and teams. They can also help you build long-term relationships with your clients and partners that can lead to future opportunities.

## Challenges of Engineering Away Teams

Communication and Coordination Issues - Engineering away teams may face challenges in communicating and coordinating with your in-house team due to language, cultural, or technical barriers. They may also struggle to align their goals and objectives with yours if they don't have a clear understanding of your company's vision and values.

Cultural and Language Barriers - Engineering away teams may encounter cultural and language barriers that can affect their ability to work effectively with your clients or partners. They may need to adapt to different work styles, norms, and expectations that may vary from country to country.

Technical and Logistical Constraints - Engineering away teams may face technical and logistical constraints that can limit their ability to access the right tools and resources. They may need to deal with slow or unreliable internet connections, power outages, or security and privacy concerns that can compromise their work.

Security and Privacy Concerns - Engineering away teams may need to comply with local regulations and standards that govern data protection, intellectual property, and other sensitive information. They may need to ensure that their communication channels and data storage systems are secure and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or cyber attacks.

## Best Practices for Managing Engineering Away Teams

Clear and Concise Project Goals and Objectives - Before you engage an engineering away team, make sure you have a clear understanding of your project goals and objectives. Define your scope, timeline, budget, and deliverables, and communicate them clearly to your away team. Set up regular check-ins and progress updates to ensure everyone is on the same page and aligned with the project's objectives.

Effective Communication Channels and Tools - Communication is key to the success of engineering away teams. Make sure you have established communication channels and tools that are accessible, reliable, and secure. Use video conferencing, chat platforms, and project management tools to ensure real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Structured Project Management Methodologies - Adopt a structured project management methodology, such as Agile or Scrum, to ensure that your engineering away team is working efficiently and effectively. Use project management tools to track progress, identify risks, and mitigate issues in real-time.

Regular Team Check-ins and Progress Updates - Regular check-ins and progress updates are essential to keep your engineering away team on track and aligned with your project objectives. Use weekly or bi-weekly meetings to review progress, discuss issues, and identify areas for improvement.

On-Site Visits and Training Sessions - Consider organizing on-site visits and training sessions to help your engineering away team get a better understanding of your company's culture, values, and work processes. This will also help build trust and rapport between your in-house team and away team, and foster a sense of collaboration and teamwork.

## Case Studies of Successful Engineering Away Teams

There are many examples of successful engineering away teams in various industries. For example, Google has a global engineering team that works remotely from different parts of the world to support its products and services. The team uses modern communication tools and agile methodologies to collaborate and innovate in real-time.

Similarly, Amazon has a distributed software engineering team that works remotely to develop and maintain its e-commerce platform. The team uses a mix of on-site and remote work to balance efficiency and collaboration, and leverage their global talent pool.

In the construction industry, Skanska has a mobile engineering team that travels to different project sites to provide technical support and expertise. The team uses a structured project management methodology and regular check-ins to ensure that they are aligned with the project's objectives and timelines.

## Conclusion

Engineering away teams can be a powerful tool for businesses looking to enhance their global competitiveness and innovation. By leveraging specialized expertise, resources, and technologies, and fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, engineering away teams can help businesses achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. However, to realize their full potential, businesses need to overcome the challenges of communication, culture, technology, and security, and adopt best practices and methodologies that can optimize their global workforce.
