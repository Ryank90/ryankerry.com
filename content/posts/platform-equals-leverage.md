summary: "I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve heard someone in a leadership meeting refer to platform engineering as “the internal IT team” or “a necessary cost.” It’s frustrating—but I get it. When you’re not close to the work, it’s easy to think of platforms as plumbing: useful, but invisible, and not something that moves the business forward."
