Earlier this year at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), I had the privilege of joining the team from Cloudflare to speak about a topic close to my heart: Zero Trust and its role in supporting the competitive gaming ecosystem.

Competitive gaming is more than just low latency and big audiences. It is a high-stakes environment where security, reliability, and fair play are non-negotiable. In our session we explored how Zero Trust principles can protect players, organisers, and platforms by ensuring that every connection, request, and interaction is verified, validated, and secure without adding unnecessary friction.

We discussed the realities of securing global tournaments and live service games, where threats can come from anywhere and downtime is never an option. From safeguarding player accounts to defending against targeted attacks, Zero Trust offers a scalable framework to keep the competitive experience safe, fair, and resilient.

It was a fantastic opportunity to share real world learnings, hear from others in the industry, and underline why security cannot be an afterthought. It needs to be designed in from the start.
