One of the most difficult responsibilities in senior leadership is guiding your team and organisation through reductions. These moments cut deeper than any product delay or operational challenge because they impact people’s livelihoods, trust, and sense of belonging. They also test whether your leadership values hold up when the situation is at its worst.

Reductions can be driven by various forces, including macroeconomic headwinds, strategic pivots, overexpansion, or the need to protect long-term sustainability. Regardless of the cause, you can’t avoid the human impact. These are not abstract restructures; they involve real people who have contributed to the organisation's success.

When I’ve had to lead through these situations, I’ve found that preparation starts well before any announcement is made. The leadership team must be completely aligned on the reasons, the scope, and the intended outcomes. Mixed messages create confusion and damage trust, so unity at the top is non-negotiable.

When it comes to communication, clarity matters more than comfort. People deserve to hear the truth plainly, with no corporate jargon or vague optimism that obscures the seriousness of the decision. Being upfront about why this is happening and how it connects to the company’s direction earns far more respect than trying to soften the blow with euphemisms.

It’s also important to acknowledge the impact openly. Reductions are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they are people whose work has helped the business get to where it is. Showing respect and gratitude for those contributions and providing meaningful support, from career transition assistance to personal introductions, shapes how both the departing and remaining employees view the company for years to come.

Once the initial communication is complete, attention must turn quickly to those who remain. Uncertainty can erode morale faster than the reduction itself, so be visible, listen to concerns without defensiveness, and adjust priorities to reflect the new reality. Making space for questions and openly sharing what’s next helps restore a sense of stability.

These moments also take a toll on leaders themselves. The weight of deciding to let people go to protect the broader organisation is heavy. Having trusted peers or mentors to debrief with helps you sustain your resilience, which in turn allows you to be present and consistent for your team.

In the weeks that follow, the focus should shift to stabilising and delivering against the revised plan. Creating small, early wins can help the team rebuild momentum. Over time, the measure of a leader is not only how they navigate the reduction itself, but how effectively they lead the recovery.

Leading through reductions is never something to take lightly. It is a test of empathy, clarity, and conviction, striking a balance between the immediate human impact and the long-term health of the business. Done well, it can leave an organisation more focused, aligned, and able to move forward, even if the path there was painful.
